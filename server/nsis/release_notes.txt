1.0
    Completely FREE and Ad-free!

    You can
     - Shutdown your computer
     - Change the volume
     - Control the mouse cursor
     - Control your keyboard
    when you're on the same LAN.

    For this you have to install a windows app on your device, which is also completely free and ad free.

    Feel free to block any access to/from the Windows app in your firewall outside your LAN, or do
    the same for your Android App as well. Ports: 9010 and 9082 has to be open on both devices, and
    local network communication has to be possible.

    The app contains a 'sleep enhancer shutdown mode', where you can configure the volume on the
    connected PC to gradually decrease until 0, and shut it down when the interpolation terminates.
    It is great, if you're watching movies on your PC before falling asleep...
